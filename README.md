# Neural Architecture Search with Nature Inspired Algorithims
This work explores the efficacy of automating neural architecture search by implementing four nature-inspired algorithms 3 of which are bio-inspired 
and the other physics-inspired and analysing the computational speed, accuracy, scalability, and other restricting issues around them

### Mnist

* MNIST set is a large collection of handwritten digits.
* MNIST is short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database
* MNIST contains a collection of 70,000, 28 x 28 greyscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
* The dataset is already divided into training and testing sets.
  * Training set of 60,000 examples 
  * Test set of 10,000 examples

### Fashion-Mnist

* Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images.
* Fashion-MNIST contains a collection of 70,000, 28 x 28 greyscale images,  associated with a label from 10 classes.
* Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. 
* Each pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.
* The 10 categories include the following, 0 T-shirt/top, 1 Trouser, 2 Pullover, 3 Dress, 4 Coat, 5 Sandal, 6 Shirt, 7 Sneaker, 8 Bag, 9 Ankle boot


### CIFAR10

*  It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset
*  CIFAR is short for Canadian Institute For Advanced Research 
*  Consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10  different classes, with 6000 images per class.
*  The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

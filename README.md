# Neural Architecture Search with Nature Inspired Algorithims
This work explores the efficacy of automating neural architecture search by implementing four nature-inspired algorithms 3 of which are bio-inspired 
and the other physics-inspired and analysing the computational speed, accuracy, scalability, and other restricting issues around them

### Mnist

* MNIST set is a large collection of handwritten digits.
* MNIST is short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database
* MNIST contains a collection of 70,000, 28 x 28 greyscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
* The dataset is already divided into training and testing sets.
  * Training set of 60,000 examples 
  * Test set of 10,000 examples

### Fashion-Mnist

* Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images.
* Fashion-MNIST contains a collection of 70,000, 28 x 28 greyscale images,  associated with a label from 10 classes.
* Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. 
* Each pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.
* The 10 categories include the following, 0 T-shirt/top, 1 Trouser, 2 Pullover, 3 Dress, 4 Coat, 5 Sandal, 6 Shirt, 7 Sneaker, 8 Bag, 9 Ankle boot


### CIFAR10

*  It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset
*  CIFAR is short for Canadian Institute For Advanced Research 
*  Consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10  different classes, with 6000 images per class.
*  The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## Project Architecture
The project features 4 key components, in which 4 different algorithims are implemented as search strategies to operate within their givben search space to to find the best neural network architecture.  

Where prior research has deemed that strategies for NAS could be classified and divided accordingly into three dimensions: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation/prediction strategy
### Genetic Algorithims

Each model is represented as fixed-width genome encoding information about the network's structure. a model contains a number of convolutional layers, a number of dense layers, and an optimizer. The convolutional layers can be evolved to include varying numbers of feature maps, different activation functions, varying proportions of dropout, and whether to perform batch normalization and/or max pooling. The same options are available for the dense layers with the exception of max pooling.

### DeepSwarm

(1) The ant is placed on the input node. (2) The ant checks what transitions are available. (3) The ant uses the ACS selection rule to choose the next node. (4) After choosing the next node the ant selects nodeâ€™s attributes. (5) After all ants finished their tour the pheromone is updated. (6) The maximum allowed depth is increased and the new ant population is generated.
**Note**: Arrow thickness indicates the pheromone amount, meaning that thicker arrows have more pheromone.
